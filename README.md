# README
This is a template vault that you may like to borrow inspiration from as you set up your own vault. 

The [Getting Started configuration guide](https://github.com/thor314/obsidian-setup/blob/main/Getting%20Started%20with%20Obsidian.md) gives instructions for getting started with Obsidian, getting going with Obsidian with a couple different workflows, and an opinionated take on about 100 plugins and how to use them for your workflows. 

The post is aimed at a wide audience; if you use Obsidian or would like to, this post aims help you make the most of it.

To get started, clone this repository as a starter template repository for your own uses. The repo contains an `.obsidian` and `.obsidian.vimrc` configuration with the settings and plugins I use, and the *Getting Started with Obsidian* post. 

If you'd prefer to follow along by manually setting up your vault, I recommend copying the [raw markdown of the post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thor314/obsidian-setup/main/Getting%20Started%20with%20Obsidian.md) into a note in your vault in Reading View.
