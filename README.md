# README
This is a template vault that you may like to borrow inspiration from as you set up your own vault. 

The [Getting Started configuration guide](https://github.com/thor314/obsidian-setup/blob/main/Getting%20Started%20with%20Obsidian.md) gives instructions for:
- getting started with Obsidian, and a couple useful settings
- getting going with a couple different workflows
- an opinionated take on about 100 plugins and how to use them for your workflows

The post is aimed at a wide audience; if you use Obsidian or would like to, this post aims help you make the most of it.
In particular, I discuss how to use Obsidian for:
- journaling
- note taking
- project and task management
- self-organization
- general writing 

To get started, clone this repository as a starter template repository for your own uses. The repo contains an `.obsidian` and `.obsidian.vimrc` configuration with the settings and plugins I use, and the *Getting Started with Obsidian* post. 

If you'd prefer to follow along by manually setting up your vault, I recommend copying the [raw markdown of the post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thor314/obsidian-setup/main/Getting%20Started%20with%20Obsidian.md) into a note in your vault in Reading View. 

### An aside on the security of installing plugins
Plugins are great, and I will recommend many of them. They're also a security risk. I weakly claim that none of the
community plugins I install or recommend are out to pwn your system, but I could be wrong. To my knowledge, the Obsidian
developers do audit community plugins for security concerns, but they could miss something. Consider being cautious of
newer plugins with fewer installs.

### Changelog
Roughly bi-annual updates to this vault since end of 2022.
- 2023-12-22 - tweet got some attention so did one more light editing pass and cleaned up vimrc + preamble.sty. Then cleaned up part 3.

- 2023-05-31 - how was I this bad at writing...added a few plugins, gcal, hotkey helper, latex preamble

### Todo:
