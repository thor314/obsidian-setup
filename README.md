# README
The article gives instructions for getting started with Obsidian, getting going with Obsidian with a couple different workflows, and an opinionated take on about 100 plugins and how to use them for your workflows.

The post is aimed at a wide audience; if you use Obsidian or would like to, this post aims help you make the most of it.

To get started, clone this repository as a starter template repository for your own uses. The repo contains an `.obsidian` and `.obsidian.vimrc` configuration with the settings and plugins I recommend, and the *Getting Started with Obsidian* post.

If you'd prefer to follow along by manually setting up your vault, I recommend copying the [raw markdown of the post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thor314/obsidian-setup/main/Getting%20Started%20with%20Obsidian.md) into a note in your vault in Reading View. This enables links to open plugin-previews directly, from within your vault.

**A note on security**: I weakly claim that none of the community plugins I install or recommend are out to pwn your system, but I could be wrong. If you installed Obsidian unsandboxed, your system is more vulnerable to malicious plugin authors. A way to avoid this is to either:
- Audit every plugin and update yourself. Auditing plugins is time-intensive, but is the only way to be absolutely confident in your system security.
- Prefer only plugins with many downloads, in which case, a malicious or compromised plugin maintainer will only pwn you *and* everyone else. 
- Use a sandboxed installation, which prevents Obsidian from poking your system except in very constrained ways, but will prevent plugins like *Obsidian Git* from being able to poke your system for automated git backups.
- Live with risk. This isn't necessarily bad, just know that you might not want to keep anything too valuable on a machine with a larger attack surface.

Pick your poison!
